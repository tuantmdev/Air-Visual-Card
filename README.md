# Air Visual Card

![example](images/example.png)

This is a Home Assistant Lovelace card that uses the [AirVisual Sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/sensor.airvisual/) and creates a card like the ones found on [AirVisual website](https://www.airvisual.com). Requires the [AirVisual Sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/sensor.airvisual/) to be setup. Tested with Yahoo Weather component.

## Features
  - Card colors and icons change depending on AQI level
  
  
## Options

| Name | Type | Default | Description
| ---- | ---- | ------- | -----------
| air_pollution_level | string | **Required** | Name of the Air Pollution Level sensor created by Airvisual component.
| air_quality_index | string | **Required** | Name of the Air Quality Index sensor created by Airvisual component.
| main_pollutant | string | **Required** | Name of the Main Pollutant sensor created by Airvisual component.
| temp | string | Optional| Name of the temperature sensor or weather entity, such as 'weather.yweather' or 'sensor.yweather_temperature'
| city | string | Optional | Name of the city that AirVisual is collecting AQI data from.


## Instructions
1. Install the [AirVisual sensor](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/sensor.airvisual/) and confirm AQI, APL, and Main Pollutant sensors are created, like below.

1. Download the [AirVisual Card](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dnguyen800/Air-Visual-Card/master/air-visual-card.js)
2. Place the file in your `config/www` folder
3. Include the card code in the Resources section of your `ui-lovelace-card.yaml`
```yaml
resources:
  - url: /local/air-visual-card.js
    type: js
```
4. Write configuration for the card in your `ui-lovelace.yaml` and list your AirVisual sensors. An example is provided below:

```yaml
  - type: custom:air-visual-card
    air_pollution_level: sensor.us_air_pollution_level
    air_quality_index: sensor.us_air_quality_index
    main_pollutant: sensor.us_main_pollutant
    temp: weather.yweather
    city: 'San Francisco'
```
5. Restart Home Assistant to load the card.

## FAQ
 - The card doesn't show the temperature properly
  
   Let me know which weather provider you are using and I'll try to fix the issue. I have only tested with the Yahoo! Weather component. Optionally, if you create a template sensor that reports the temperature as its state, you can use that sensor as for the temp config.
 
 - This card doesn't work in Fully Kiosk Browser on Amazon Fire tablets. Why?

   This card uses a new CSS function, CSS Grid Layout, which was implemented in October 2018, and isn't compatible with browsers using old versions of Android WebView. That's my guess anyways.

 
## Support
I am studying programming as a hobby and this is my first set of Home Assistant projects. Unfortunately, I know nothing about Javascript and relied on studying other Lovelace custom cards to write this. Suggestions are welcome but no promises if I can fix anything! If you're familiar with CSS, then you can edit the CSS style in the .js file directly.
